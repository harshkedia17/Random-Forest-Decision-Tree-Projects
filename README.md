# Random Forest Projects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This folder contains project made using Random Forest which includes :
* Loan Repayment Prediction
  * For this project we will be exploring 	publicly available data from 	[LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). 	Lending Club connects people who need 	money (borrowers) with people who have 	money (investors). Hopefully, as an 	investor you would want to invest in 	people who showed a profile of having a 	high probability of paying you back. We 	will try to create a model that will help 	predict this.
	We will use lending data from 2007-2010 	and be trying to classify and predict 	whether or not the borrower paid back 	their loan in full.


* Kyphosis Diagnosis Prediction
  * An increased front-to-back curve of the upper spine is called kyphosis. We diagnose the given data and predict whether the person is suffering from kyphosis or not.

## The file consists of the csv data and the jupyter notebook of the above projects.
